# Catholic-Website
This project aims to be a Catholic website with plenty of free resources for learning about the Catholic Faith, and will be specifically geared towards Catholics living in oppressive countries. We aim to create a .onion site accessible over TOR for those who wish to learn more about the faith in countries where it is either difficult or illegal to spread such material.
