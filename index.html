        I pray this finds you well. This is a website mainly for those who live in countries where the Catholic Faith is supressed, illegal, or censored. It is meant to be a resource for Catholics, Catechumens, and those who wish to know more about the teachings of the Catholic Church.

      This .onion site is currently being developed, but will soon host the following: Catholic Catechisms, theology books, Bibles, PDF and .TXT files on Catholic spirituality, the lives of the saints, and other sources of information on the Catholic Church.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, we hope to host content in MULTIPLE LANGUAGES and CATHOLIC CHATROOMS for those who wish to communicate with fellow Catholics in a secure way. The latter will take a long time to impliment in a secure way, and we do not currently have an estimated time frame.
